# ESP32 Stratum1 NTP Server

Low power WiFi NTP Stratum 1 Server. Developed on ESP-32 with ublox NEO M8 wired into GPIO16 and GPIO17 and setup to monitor specific UBX protocols. Wrote my own ubx parser initially but code uses https://github.com/simondlevy/UBX_Parser straight out the box.

Give me a ping if you have any questions.
